    "content": "Superposition is a fundamental principle where a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. Imagine a coin spinning in the air - it's both heads and tails at once. Only when it lands (measurement) does it choose a state.\n\nThis allows quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously, making them exponentially more powerful for certain tasks.",
